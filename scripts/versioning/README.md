# Versioning in Monorepos

Oh boy was this rewarding but tricky.

## Overview

The journey of implementing versioning in a monorepo is fraught with challenges, many of which deter developers from this approach. Initially, the complexity and potential issues can seem daunting. However, the benefits and efficiencies gained from a successful implementation are well worth the effort. This document delves into the intricacies of versioning within a monorepo, drawing on specific script functionalities to elucidate the process.

## The Versioning Process

1. **Component Updates and Dependencies:**
   - In a monorepo, when a component is updated, all dependent components must also be updated to reference the latest version. This ensures consistency and compatibility across the repository.
   - Only non-dev dependencies should receive a version bump, specifically a `patch`, to prevent unnecessary releases and maintain version integrity.

2. **Global Installation:**
   - After updating component versions, a global installation is necessary to apply these changes throughout the monorepo, finalizing the "version flood".

## Addressing Challenges

The versioning process encounters several challenges, particularly with the execution of pre-version and post-version scripts for each component, and the utilization of global scripts. These challenges are met as follows:

### Pre-Version Script

- **Initialization:** Ensures the setup of versioning information. If this information does not already exist, the script initiates it, laying the groundwork for subsequent operations.
- **Remote Information Fetching:** Attempts to fetch the latest version information from the npm registry. If the internet connection fails, it falls back on local `.env` files, which may contain the needed version information.
- **Version Determination:** If the fetched version matches the current version, the script interprets this as a cue to increase the version. Otherwise, if a version increase is detected, it refrains from further increments, acknowledging the update has already been applied.

### Post-Version Script

- **Global Script Invocation:** After the standard versioning call, this script activates a global versioning script, which is crucial for cascading version updates across all dependent components.
- **Recursive Versioning:** Ensures that all components referencing the updated component receive a version bump. This recursive process continues until no further updates are needed.
- **Exit Strategy**: The post-version script includes an exit 4 command, which serves as a deliberate error signal to halt further automated processes, such as unnecessary installations that might be prompted by npm's erratic behavior. This step is crucial for maintaining control over the workflow and minimizing redundant operations.

## The Cleanup Stage

After the versioning process, a cleanup stage is necessary to remove temporary `node_modules` and the global versioning file. This step ensures the monorepo is left in a clean state, with all components accurately versioned and no residual clutter.

## Leveraging Script Functionalities

### Local Pre and Post-Version Scripts

- **Local Pre-Version Script:** Utilizes global utilities to handle fetching and initializing version information in a detailed manner, ensuring that pre-version preparations are thorough and robust.
- **Local Post-Version Script:** Focuses on finalizing the versioning process, invoking global scripts to manage the recursive updating of components and the cleanup phase.

### Global Scripts

- **Main and Run Files:** The global scripts, particularly through the main.js and run.sh files, provide a high level of detail and control over the versioning process. They facilitate the efficient handling of dependencies, version increments, and the overall orchestration of the versioning workflow.
- **Logging and Output:** An essential feature of the global scripts is their sophisticated logging capability, offering clear insights into the versioning process. This logging is instrumental in tracking the progress of updates, identifying any issues, and ensuring transparency throughout the process.

## Conclusion

Implementing versioning in a monorepo involves navigating a complex landscape of dependencies, scripts, and potential pitfalls. By leveraging local and global scripts effectively, it's possible to manage component versions with precision, ensuring a harmonious and up-to-date codebase. This document has outlined the key steps and considerations in this process, aiming to provide a clear roadmap for managing versioning in monorepos.
