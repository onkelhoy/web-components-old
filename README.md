# My Ecosystem

**Author**: Henry Pap

## Background

I've developed this ad a spite i've had to some collegues who did nothing and to prove them I could do what they did 10 times I started something, but it grew more and more and now I must say it is very good and I have taken this project to heart as it will help all my future projects (when it comes to web development).

Many stuff still missing but day by day..

### Scope

Scope of this framework is to bring many a way to develop component to a much easier level where you get out of the box presentation of your work. You should mainly only focus on your code and test (still ongoing..) and you do this mainly inside the demo folder inside the views.

The other stuff you will get for free from the analyse script that would generate you some pages like interactive to play around with what you've built, variations that would generate all variations based on your properties and documentation (wip that takes source code and asks AI to create doc for it). Later it would be cool to bring test, asset and a raw page as well.

There's many tools inside this monorepo such as markdown, codeblock. And all scripts such as server, analyze, publish etc comes from here making almost a 0 dependency dev library (but cant do it all by myself).

It heavily depends on the esbuilt which is just amazing!

### Goal

to become 0 dependency, f all the rest and their shitty code!

## How to use it
