## Introduction

Welcome to my ecosystem building web-components. Theres many things going on here and I hope that one day soon there will be a wiki page that will address each individual piece at isolation.

But in general this is a zero-dependency library (at produciton) that tries to use as little as possible to develop and ship web components. Almost everything from dev-server to rendering engine has been developed by scratch and its all open source to be able to see how it works and potentially modify to fit your own case.

Many things do come out of the box, such as analyzing code to get properties, events etc to use these to build some generative pages
