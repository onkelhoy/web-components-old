# Molecules

## Overview

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together, forming more complex UI components. Examples include form fields with labels, search bars, and card components.

## Usage

Molecules are utilized for creating sections of interfaces that require multiple atoms. They serve as the intermediate building blocks between atoms and organisms.

## Guidelines

- Molecules should function independently.
- Design for reusability and maintainability.
- Ensure they integrate well with atoms and organisms.
