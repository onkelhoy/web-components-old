# Tools

## Overview

The Tools directory functions as a utility layer within our component library, providing essential services and components that enhance the functionality and versatility of our UI elements. Initially hosting a selective suite of tools such as a translator, this directory is poised for significant expansion to accommodate the growing needs of our ecosystem.

## Usage

This section is intentionally left adaptable to accommodate the addition of new tools. Each tool within this directory is designed to offer standalone functionality that enhances or supports the broader component library in a meaningful way. Detailed usage instructions for each tool will be provided within their respective sub-directories or documentation files to ensure clear, accessible guidance for developers.

## Guidelines

- **Relevance**: Before adding a new tool to this directory, ensure its functionality serves the broader library and is not overly specific to a single component or scenario. Tools should provide utility across multiple components or use cases.
- **Clarity**: The naming of each tool should be intuitive and descriptive, allowing developers to understand its purpose at a glance. Avoid ambiguous or generic names that might lead to confusion regarding the tool's functionality.
- **Future-Proofing**: Design tools with extensibility and future enhancements in mind. As our component library evolves, so too will the demands placed on our tools. Building with scalability in mind will facilitate smoother transitions and expansions down the line.
