# Templates

## Overview

Templates in our library primarily serve as structural blueprints for page layouts, providing a consistent and cohesive framework for assembling various UI components. While their most common application is in defining page structures, their adaptable nature allows for creative uses in other component layouts.

## Usage

Primarily, use templates to define the layout and structure of pages by organizing atoms, molecules, and organisms. They can also be adapted for unique component layouts that may be reused across different parts of an application.

## Guidelines

- Focus on creating templates that offer flexibility for both page layouts and unique component assemblies.
- Ensure templates are adaptable and maintain consistency with the overall design system.
- Design for ease of use, allowing for seamless integration of various UI components.
- While templates primarily guide page structure, consider their potential for innovative layouts beyond traditional page design.
