# Organisms

## Overview

Organisms are complex UI components made of groups of molecules and atoms. Examples include headers, footers, and complex forms.

## Usage

Use organisms to build substantial parts of an interface, combining atoms and molecules into fully-functional sections.

## Guidelines

- Organisms should be self-contained and functionally independent.
- Focus on scalability and integration with other UI components.
- Prioritize modularity for easier maintenance and updates.
